                <h2>Overview:</h2>
                <p>Western gorillas are divided into two subspecies: The western lowland gorilla and the Cross River gorilla. They are not quite as large as their Eastern counterparts, and their fur is not as dark. Their fur is usually black, dark grey, or a mix of grey and brown with more brown fur on their forehead region.

                <h2>Diet:</h2>
                <p>Western gorillas diets are made up of leaves, stems, fruit, piths, flowers, bark, invertebrates, and soil. Western gorillas consume more fruit than their Eastern counterparts and only resort to eating lower quality bark and leaves in the dry season when fruit is rare. Western gorillas even eat certain foods for their medicinal properties and health benefits such as the seeds of various species. These seeds have benefits for the gorillas that range from improved cardiovascular health, caffeine-like effects, to hallucinogenic properties.

                <h2>Habitat:</h2>
                <p>Western lowland gorillas can be found in most of western Africa and are separated from Cross River gorillas, who can only be found in the Nigeria-Cameroon border region.

                <h2>Behavior:</h2>
                <p>Western gorillas live in groups and form around a dominant male called a silverback, denoted by their namesake silver fur on their backs. The rest of the group is made up of females and younger male gorillas that leave the group once they reach maturity. Female gorillas also leave the group once they reach breeding age. These groups travel around a home range of up to 12 square miles. On rare occasions they will defend themselves from human threats by throwing clumps of grass and mud, or charging at them, but they will primarily flee when encountering humans.
