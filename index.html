                    Gorillas are the largest type of great-ape and one of the animal species most closely related to humans. Not only do we share up to 98% of our DNA, we also exhibit similar emotional and reproductive behaviors. Gorillas can laugh and express sadness just like we do, and females only give birth once every several years. This slow reproduction process is reminiscent of human female reproductive patterns, and it also means that it is hard for Gorillas to recover from population decline caused by the threats they face.
                    Gorillas are divided into Eastern and Western species and each has a lowland and upland subspecies. All of these subspecies are critically endangered, with the exception of the mountain gorilla, whose rising population due to conservation efforts has had them classified as endangered instead.
                    Gorillas are primarily threatened by disease, hunting, and a lack of law enforcement. Since they are so similar to humans, Gorillas are vulnerable to many of the same diseases that we are. This includes the Ebola virus, which is as deadly for Gorillas as it is for humans. Logging and hunting activities near Gorilla habitats results in the death and destruction of the local population and their habitat. Sometimes they are caught in traps meant to catch other animals or even directly hunted for their meat to be sold illegally. Due to the weak law enforcement in areas near Gorilla habitats these illegal activities face little repercussion, further exacerbating the problem.
